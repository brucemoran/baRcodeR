Description: Tools to generate unique identifier codes and
    printable barcoded labels for the management of biological samples.
    The creation of unique ID codes and printable PDF files can be
    initiated by standard commands, user prompts, or through a GUI addin
    for R Studio. Biologically informative codes can be included for
    hierarchically structured sampling designs.
